# Steem Pay

## Introduction
SteemPay aims to help people to use SBD for selling and buying the real stuff. The primary mission of this tool is to simplify the selling and buying process using SBD.

Using SteemPay, you can create an invoice quickly, and the buyer can pay it by scanning QR code. You can also get paid without any Steem account if you have a Steem wallet in Upbit or Bittrex.

Although SteemPay only supports KRW currency for now, you can try out just for fun.

## Motivation

Korean Steemians who owns their own offline stores like pubs, restaurants or clinics have been trying to receive SBD for their products and services. However it was not as simple as they thought because:

- Converting the local currency KRW to SBD is a burden, and the exchange rate changes second by second
- No one step way for sellers and buyers to create and share an invoice
- Sellers and buyers must go through the manual processes for the payment, putting numbers by numbers
- no clear and unified way to keep the track of the transactions

**Here is the scenario of selling a cup of coffee for SBD before SteemPay**
1. Seller calculates the SBD price of the product
2. Seller gives the number like 1.352 SBD to the buyer
3. Buyer opens whatever Steem app he uses and manually puts the seller's account ID and the price, risking making typo in the sellor's Steem account.
4. Buyer also needs to put some memo about what he is paying the money for.
4. Put active key if neeeded.
5. Seller needs to check if buyer paid that amount.
6. Found any mistake in the processes above? sigh... 

SteemPay project was born to simplify this process, and has been making a great progress in his mission although it is still in its very early stage. SteemPay is now perfectly usable in Korea, and some Steemians are using it for their business already.

I will now walk you through what it does for the sellers and buyers currently.
